    "# Proyecto I: Filter Me!!\n",
    "\n",
    "El objetivo de este proyecto es desarrollar una serie de filtros donde se utilice conceptos de mejora de contraste, y uso de mascaras de filtrado espacial para alterar una imagen obtenida a travez de una camara de video, en tiempo real. La imagen adquirida y procesada debe estar en escala de color. Para este proyecto se pide que los estudiantes implementen las funciones de:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ecualización de histograma.\n",
    "2. Difuminado de imagenes.\n",
    "3. Detección de bordes.\n",
    "4. Mejora de la Nitidez (sharpness).\n",
    "\n",
    "El entregable debe cumplir las siguientes caracteristicas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Facil de usar.\n",
    "2. Se debe poder seleccionar que tipo de proceso se realiza sobre la imagen (ecualizacion de histograma, detecci'on bordes, etc)\n",
    "3. Se debe mostrar la salida en tiempo real, es decir se debe mostrar el video actual como se procesa.\n",
    "4. Tambien debe mostrar ejemplos de imagenes procesadas (Offline) con cada uno de los algoritmos implementados.\n",
    "\n",
    "Al entregar el proyecto deben presentar los programas, ya sea en un ejecutable o en un notebook de jupiter. y deben entregar las respuestas a las psiguientes preguntas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ¿Cual de los programas implementados corre de forma más lenta y cual de forma más rápida? ¿Porqué?\n",
    "2. ¿Cómo puedo mejorar la velocidad de los algoritmos de procesamiento? ¿Qué consecuencias tiene esto?\n",
    "3. Si los programas tienen problemas para realizar las operaciones dentro del tiempo considerado tiempo real, ¿cómo se puede mejorar esto?\n",
    "4. ¿Fueron los resultados obtenidos satisfactorios? Elabore su respuesta.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Para realizar los programas pueden usar las librerias opencv, esta soporta el manejo de video. Por otro lado pueden usar [gradio](https://gradio.app) para desarrollar una interfaz de forma facil.\n",
    "\n",
    "Para el desarrollo del proyecto se debne hacer en grupos de dos personas (solo se admite un grupo de 3). Tenga en cuenta que con quien desarrolla este proyecto, no puede desarrollar proyecto en un futuro. **La fecha limite de entrega del proyecto es el Lunes 28 de Febrero del 2022.**\n",
